 adamantiumDESC: "Adamantium was the third metal found to possess magical properties. It's typically found in the form of auric adamantide compounds. Adamantium is prized for its unparalleled endurance while still remaining flexile. For this reason, after its discovery it was mostly used as material for noblemen's blades and later for infantry weapons, armour, and cannons. However, as more potent arcane materials came into circulation, it was later also used for potions, vessels, and several other arcane products."
