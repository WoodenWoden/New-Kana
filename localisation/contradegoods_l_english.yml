 adamantiumDESC: "Adamantium was the first mineral found to possess magical properties. It's typically found near deposits of gold and very rarely copper. Adamantium is prized for its unparalleled endurance while still remaining flexile. For this reason, after its discovery it was mostly used as material for noblemen's blades, and later for cannons. However, as more magically inclined materials came into circulation, it was later also used for potions, vessels, and many other arcane tools."
