 CUITEAN_LORDS: "Cuitean Lords"
 CUITEAN_LORDS_DESC: "The eminent lords of Cuite have always shared a prominent part in the history of East Niapti. With the growing union between the great kingdoms of Lom and Pen, Bist faces pressure to expand into the southern princedoms. The princedom of Wug lost their western border in 1442 and has yet to reclaim it. Lords of Cuite not only vow to reform their noble country, but also to project their power upon other countries in the East Niaptic Empire."
